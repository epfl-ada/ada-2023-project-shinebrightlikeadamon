# A Star Cast is Born: Striking Gold with the Perfect Lineup

## Abstract
In movie-making, picking the right cast is key to a film's triumph. Our project sheds light on what directors should consider when casting. Central to our investigation is the effect of an actor's gender and ethnic mix on a movie's reception. We're also keen on finding the perfect age for characters, aiming for authenticity and relatability.

We go beyond mere talent, examining if an actor's fame and past awards can lift a film's ratings. Does having an award-winner or a star lead to better ratings? Alongside this, we look into how connections between actors affect a movie's charm.

Our analysis doesn't stop there. We also delve into the financial aspect, scrutinizing how these factors translate into box office revenues. This guide aims to equip directors with insights for assembling a cast that excels both in capturing hearts and at the box office, propelling a film to the peak of ratings. We will analyze the 25'515 movies that have been rated by IMDB users to create a recipe for a successful cast.

## Research Questions ü§®
In our project, we define the success of a movie in terms of IMDB ratings. To provide the perfect cast, we will answer the following questions:

1. How does an actor's `gender` and `ethnicity` influence the ratings of a film?
2. Ageing to Perfection: What is the optimal `age` for portraying specific character type?
3. Do stars make movies shine brighter? How does `popularity`, a previous nomination or `award` received by an actor impact the ratings of a movie?
4. How do `connections between actors` influence each other's contribution to movie ratings?
5. Is popularity everything? Do high ratings correspond to high `box-office revenue`?

## Additional Datasets üíΩ
1. IMDB [dataset](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/): Ratings from IMDB. We are going to use the ratings as the dependent variable for our analysis. We merge it with each movie in the `movie.metadata.csv` by `(name,release_year,runtime)` as unique key.
2. The Movies [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?resource=download&select=movies_metadata.csv) for budgets, to isolate the influence of high rating in the `box office revenue`.
3. Awards [dataset](https://datahub.io/rufuspollock/oscars-nominees-and-winners#resource-oscars-nominees-and-winners_zip): containing all Oscars winners and nominees since 1927. It will be used to gauge the actors academically so we merged it with the `character.metadata.tsv` dataframe, to include actor's awards up to that movie.
4. Actor popularity [dataset](https://today.yougov.com/ratings/entertainment/fame/all-time-actors-actresses/all): `Fame`, `popularity`, `liked`, `disliked` and `neutral` ratios among US population (scrapped data).
5. Inflation [dataset](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG?end=2022&start=1960&view=chart): Consumer prices increase since 1960. This dataset will be used to adjust `budget` and `box office revenue` of the movies.

## Methods üìä

### ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): 
We perform Analysis of Variance (an extension of the t-test used to compare the means of three or more groups), specifically Two-Way ANOVA, to compare the means of movie ratings (a single continuous dependent variable) across different groups of actors based on gender and ethnicity (two categorical independent variables). 

Additionally, we use ANOVA to determines if the means of ratings across multiple character type and actor age clusters are significantly different.

### Cluster Analysis: 
We group movies based on character types and analyze the age distribution of actors in these roles to identify trends.

Using the character type categorization in the data set, we select character types present in each movie and the ages of the actors playing those roles as features, and apply K-means to identify clusters or groups of movies that share similar patterns regarding these features. We then analyze the relationship between these clusters and movie ratings through ANOVA (using character types and ages as independent categorical variables). 

### Time Series Analysis: 
We use Time Series Analysis to examine how an actor's win or nomination for an award influences the ratings of their subsequent movies. 

We collect time-stamped data on the actor's award nominations/wins and the ratings of their movies (time-stamped with their release date) over time, resulting in one time series for the actor's awards and another for movie ratings, which we then perform Regression Analysis on.

### Paired Matching
We employed paired matching to examine potential causal relationships within observed correlations between time-stamped award nominations/wins and movie ratings. We standardized the continuous variables, calculated propensity scores and performed the matching. 

### Regression Analysis:
We apply Regression Analysis on the Time Series Analysis to determine how an actor's award win or nomination influences the ratings of their subsequent movies. 

### Network Analysis: 
By mapping out the connections between co-starring actors, we analyze if and how these networks correlate with movie ratings. This analysis can reveal influential actors whose connections might positively or negatively impact a movie's ratings. Representing the actors as nodes and their connections as edges, using degree centrality to measure the number of connections an actor has within a network to understand the actor's prominence or influence in the movie industry.    

### Correlation Analysis: 
We perform Correlation Analysis, with Pearson's Correlation Coefficient, to find out if there's a statistical relationship ratings are box-office revenue.

## Milestones üóø

### 1. Data Processing and Preparation
- **Movie Metadata:**
  - Added average rating from the IMBD dataset, adjust box office revenue with inflation in the US from the additional dataset to be able to compare them, implemented budget values and adjust them like box office. We also added the size of the cast, the number of awards/nominations of the cast and its average popularity and experience.
- **Character Metadata:**
  - Includes all actor data adjusted to the release date of the movie: age, awards, experience.
- **Actor Data:**
  - Collected all the following data per actor:
    - Popularity, %liked, %disliked, %neutral in the US population.
    - Total number of movies made
    - Number of awards/nominations
    - General data as birth, gender, height and etnicity.	

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Task 2.1:** Conduct descriptive statistical analysis to understand basic trends and distributions within the dataset.
- **Task 2.2:** Visualize key variables (actor age, gender, ethnicity, awards,...) to gain initial insights and identify potential patterns or outliers.

### 3. Analyzing Actor Demographics
- **Task 3.1:** Utilize regression analysis to examine the relationship between an actor's gender and ethnicity and the movies' IMDB ratings.
- **Task 3.2:** Perform ANOVA to compare the mean ratings across different demographic groups of actors.

### 4. Character Type and Age Analysis
- **Task 4.1:** Conduct cluster analysis to group movies based on character types.
- **Task 4.2:** Analyze actors' age distribution within these clusters using descriptive statistics to determine optimal ages for character types.

### 5. Impact of Awards and Popularity
- **Task 5.1:** Use time series analysis to assess actor award history's impact on movie ratings.
- **Task 5.2:** Use correlation analysis to explore actor popularity's impact on movie ratings.

### 6. Network Analysis of Actor Connections

## Questions for TA ‚ùî

  - Could we drop all movies with no revenues (only 10% has), so we have a consistent dataset for all questions? Or should we use different datatset for each question?
  - Should we implement the same threshold for all question for characaters, in other words, should we make a single dataset that fits every question? Or can we filter out per question, as an exemple, we remove character with no etnicity for the 1st questions but we keep them for the age question.
