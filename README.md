# A Star Cast is Born: Striking Gold with the Perfect Lineup

## Abstract
In movie-making, picking the right cast is key to a film's triumph. Our project sheds light on what directors should consider when casting. Central to our investigation is the effect of an actor's gender and ethnic mix on a movie's reception. We're also keen on finding the perfect age for characters, aiming for authenticity and relatability.

We go beyond mere talent, examining if an actor's fame and past awards can lift a film's ratings. Does having an award-winner or a star lead to better ratings? Alongside this, we look into how connections between actors affect a movie's charm.

Our analysis doesn't stop there. We also delve into the financial aspect, scrutinizing how these factors translate into box office revenues. This guide aims to equip directors with insights for assembling a cast that excels both in capturing hearts and at the box office, propelling a film to the peak of ratings.

## Research Questions ü§®
In our project, we define the success of a movie in terms of IMDB ratings. To provide the perfect cast, we will answer the following five questions:

1. How does an actor's `gender` and `ethnicity` influence the ratings of a film?
2. Ageing to Perfection: What is the optimal `age` for portraying specific character type?
3. Do stars make movies shine brighter? How does `popularity`, a previous nomination or `award` received by an actor impact the ratings of a movie?
4. How do `connections between actors` influence each other's contribution to movie ratings?
5. Is popularity everything? Do high ratings correspond to high `box-office revenue`?

## Additional Datasets üíΩ
1. IMDB [dataset](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/): Ratings from IMDB. We are going to use the ratings as the dependent variable for our analysis. We merge it with each movie in the `movie.metadata.csv` by combining by `(name,release_year,runtime)` as unique key.
2. The Movies [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?resource=download&select=movies_metadata.csv) for budgets, to isolate the influence of high rating in the `box office revenue`.
3. Awards [dataset](https://datahub.io/rufuspollock/oscars-nominees-and-winners#resource-oscars-nominees-and-winners_zip): This dataset contains all the winners and the nominees of the Oscars since 1927. It will be used to gauge the actors academically so we merged it with the `character.metadata.tsv` dataframe, to add the awards won until that movie by the actor.
4. Actor popularity [dataset](https://today.yougov.com/ratings/entertainment/fame/all-time-actors-actresses/all): `Fame`, `popularity`, `liked`, `disliked` and `neutral` ratios among US population (scrapped data).
5. Inflation [dataset](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG?end=2022&start=1960&view=chart): Consumer prices increase since 1960. This dataset will be used to adjust (`budget` and) `box office revenue` of the movies, mostly for our last question.

## Methods üìä

### Regression Analysis:
We would use regression analysis to model the relationship between actor‚Äôs gender and ethnicity and movie ratings. We would then be able to quantify the extent to which gender and ethnicity are associated with changes in movie ratings. We could also use it to create models to predict box-office revenue based on movie ratings and other factors.

### ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): 
This can help in comparing the means of movie ratings across different groups of actors based on gender and ethnicity.

### Cluster Analysis: 
Group movies based on character types and analyze the age distribution of actors in these roles to identify trends.

### Time Series Analysis: 
Analyze how an actor's win or nomination in awards influences the ratings of their subsequent movies.

### Network Analysis: 
By mapping out the connections between co-starring actors, we can analyze if and how these networks correlate with movie ratings. This analysis can reveal influential actors whose connections might positively or negatively impact the ratings.

### Correlation Analysis: 
We would use this method to find out if there's a statistical relationship between actors' connections and the ratings of movies they're in and to determine if high ratings are associated with high box-office revenue.

### General Pre-Processing
  1. Movie Metadata:
      - Added average rating from the IMBD dataset, adjust box office revenue with inflation in the US from the additional dataset to be able to compare them, implemented budget values and adjust them like box office. We also added the size of the cast, the number of awards/nominations of the cast and its average popularity and experience.
  2. Character Metadata:
      - Includes all actor data adjusted to the release date of the movie: age, awards, experience.
  3. Actor Data:
      - Collected all the following data per actor:
      - Popularity, %liked, %disliked, %neutral in the US population.
      - Total number of movies made
      - Number of awards/nominations
      - General data as birth, gender, height and etnicity.

## Questions for TA ‚ùî

  - Could we drop all movies with no revenues (only 10% has), so we have a consistent dataset for all questions? Or should we use different datatset for each question?
  - Should we implement the same threshold for all question for charcaters, in other words, should we make a single dataset that fits every question? Or can we filter out per question, as an exemple, we remove character with no etnicity for the 1st questions but we keep them for the age question.
